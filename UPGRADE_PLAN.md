## 📋 **Pre-Upgrade Checklist**

### Desktop/Laptop Preparation:
1. **Backup current system**: Full system backup or VM snapshot
2. **Document current setup**: List installed packages, configurations
3. **Test upgrade path**: Verify Ubuntu 22.04 → 24.04 upgrade works
4. **Verify hardware support**: Check all hardware works with 24.04

### Pi 5 Preparation:
1. **Download Ubuntu 24.04 for Pi**: Get official Pi 5 image
2. **Backup current Pi setup**: Clone SD card if needed
3. **Prepare fresh install**: Clean Ubuntu 24.04 installation

## 🔄 **Upgrade Sequence**

### Phase 1: Desktop (Test Environment)
```bash
# 1. Backup current state
sudo timeshift --create --comments "Pre-24.04-upgrade backup"

# 2. Upgrade to Ubuntu 24.04
sudo do-release-upgrade

# 3. Install ROS 2 Jazzy
# [New scripts will be created for this]

# 4. Verify compatibility
./scripts/verify_environment.sh
```

### Phase 2: Laptop (Secondary)
- Repeat Desktop process after Desktop success

### Phase 3: Pi 5 (Final)
- Fresh Ubuntu 24.04 install
- Run Pi setup script

## 🧪 **Verification Steps**
